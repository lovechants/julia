## PTX 

This is just a few ptx kernels I've felt are simple enough for me to understand and write for the library to try and speed up computation and learn PTX in the process.

I am planning on keep it to very basic operations for now (addtion, subtraction, etc), but I will just make a kernel for anything that I think is reasonable and seems fun. 

> Note : I am trying to note down all the steps and processes going on in th kernel for maintaiblity and scaling of the overall library
